    <h3><strong>✅What is a self-protrait session?</strong></h3>
    <h4><i>A self-shoot session means you’re the photographer and the model! You’ll use our high-quality camera and wireless remote to take your own photos in a private studio. It’s fun, empowering, and totally in your control.</i></h4>
      <h3><strong>✅Will someone help me?</strong></h3>
      <h4><i>Yes! A staff member will greet you, help with setup, and walk you through how everything works before your session starts. During the shoot, you’ll have full privacy and creative freedom.</i></h4>
      <h3><strong>✅How long is each session?</strong></h3>
    <h4><i>Each session includes 30 or 60 minutes in Studio 1 & 2. After your session, you’ll have 10 minutes to choose your photos you would like to print. Studio 3 sessions run in either 15 or 30 minutes and 5 minutes photo selection. Guests will have 2 prints each for Studio 1 & 2 and 1 print each guest for Studio 3.</i></h4>

           <h3><strong>✅What's the difference between the 3 Studios?</strong></h3>
        <h4>
          <i>
          <ul>
          <li>Studio 1 – Great for full-body shots and creative movements</li>
          <li>Studio 2 – Perfect for close-ups, headshots and detail-focused portraits</li>
          <li>Studio 3 – A bold, all-red photobooth-style space with a high-angle camera setup for dramatic, creative shots.</li>

         <h3><strong>✅Can I bring someone with me?</strong></h3>
    <h4><i>Yes! Our base price admits 2 guests(including YOU). Additional guests are $15/person. Children under the age of 5 are FREE. You may not count them as guests when booking.</i></h4>
           <h3><strong>✅Are pets allowed in your studio?</strong></h3>
    <h4><i>Yes, we’re pet-friendly —but with a few guidelines! Pets are welcome only if they’re part of your booking. They’re considered a guest, just like everyone else! For the comfort of all visitors, we don’t allow pets to hang around the space unless they’re included in a session.</i></h4>
        <h3><strong>✅What should I bring?</strong></h3>
    <h4><i>You only need to bring yourself and your creative vision. We supply all the essential equipment, including lighting and backdrops. Feel free to bring your favourite outfits, props, or anything you’d love in your photos. We provide a selection of props in the studio as well.</i></h4>
           <h3><strong>✅Can I bring food or drinks?</strong></h3>
    <h4><i>Cakes, cupcakes, candy, and other small desserts are welcome as props. Please note that cake-smash sessions or other intentionally messy activities are not allowed, and all other food and drinks (except bottled water) are restricted.
If any spills or damage occur, a cleaning fee may apply, so please handle food props with care. If unsure whether the food you plan to bring is allowed, please don’t hesitate to message us. We’ll be happy to assist you!</i></h4>
         <h3><strong>✅How do I book a session?</strong></h3>
    <h4><i>Booking a session is simple and easy.

Finally, confirm and pay for your session. As of now, walk-ins are welcome depending on availability.
</i></h4>
        <h3><strong>✅Can I cancel or reschedule?</strong></h3>
